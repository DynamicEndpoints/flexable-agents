## Best Practices for AI Coding Agents

When creating issues for AI coding agents:

1. **Be Specific**: Provide exact function names, file paths, and requirements
2. **Include Context**: Share relevant code snippets and documentation links
3. **Define Success**: Clear acceptance criteria that can be verified
4. **Follow Patterns**: Reference existing code patterns to follow
5. **Consider Edge Cases**: Specify error handling and boundary conditions
6. **Test Requirements**: Include unit test specifications
7. **Quality Standards**: Reference coding standards and linting requirements

## Template Features

### Structured Data Collection
- Dropdown menus for consistent categorization
- Checkboxes for multiple selections
- Text areas with appropriate rendering (JSON, markdown, text)
- Required fields for essential information

### AI-Optimized Fields
- **Files to Modify**: Explicit list of target files
- **Context**: Code snippets and documentation links
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Verifiable completion conditions
- **Notes for AI**: Specific instructions for automated agents

### Quality Assurance
