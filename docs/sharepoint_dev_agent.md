2. Update configuration with your tenant details:
```json
{
    "sharepoint": {
        "development": {
            "environments": {
                "dev": {
                    "site_url": "https://your-tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/dev"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Create SharePoint Site
```python
result = await agent.process_task(Task(
    task_type="sharepoint_development",
    input_data={
        "action": "create_site",
        "site_name": "Development Site",
        "site_alias": "dev-site",
        "template": "TeamSite"
    }
))
```

### Deploy SPFx Solution
```powershell
.\scripts\deploy_spfx.ps1 -SolutionPath "path/to/solution" -Environment "dev"
```

### Create Power App
```python
result = await agent.process_task(Task(
    task_type="power_apps_development",
    input_data={
        "action": "create_app",
        "app_name": "Project Tracker",
        "environment": "dev",
        "template": "blank"
    }
))
```

## Workflows

### Business Solution Workflow
Creates a complete business solution with:
- SharePoint lists for data storage
- Power App for user interface
- Power Automate flows for automation
- Power BI reports for analytics

### Migration Workflow
Handles SharePoint migration with:
- Pre-migration assessment
- Content preparation
- Incremental migration
- Post-migration validation

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Adding New Features
1. Create new task type in `sharepoint_dev_agent.py`
2. Add configuration in `sharepoint_dev_config_template.json`
3. Create tests in `tests/test_sharepoint_dev_agent.py`
4. Update documentation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. Authentication failures
   - Check tenant ID and credentials
   - Verify permissions

2. Migration errors
   - Run pre-migration assessment
   - Check source/target compatibility
   - Verify network connectivity

3. Power Platform deployment issues
   - Check environment URLs
   - Verify solution dependencies
   - Review deployment logs

## Best Practices

### Development
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Write comprehensive tests
- Document all features

### Deployment
- Always test in dev environment first
- Use incremental deployment
- Maintain deployment scripts
- Monitor deployment logs

### Migration
- Run pre-migration assessment
- Test with sample content
- Use incremental migration
- Validate after migration

## Security

### Authentication
- Use certificate-based authentication
- Implement least privilege access
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Monitor access logs

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Use secure connections
- Implement backup strategy
- Monitor data access

## Monitoring

### Metrics
